                    Cabernet Franc is one of the major black grape varieties worldwide. It is principally grown for
                    blending with Cabernet Sauvignon and Merlot in the Bordeaux style, but can also be vinified alone,
                    as in the Loire's Chinon.

                    Pinot noir is a red wine grape variety of the species Vitis vinifera. The name may also refer to
                    wines created predominantly from pinot noir grapes. The name is derived from the French words for

                    Semillon is a golden-skinned grape used to make dry and sweet white wines, mostly in France and
                    Australia. Its thin skin and susceptibility to botrytis make it dominate the sweet wine region

                    originated in the Burgundy wine region of eastern France, but is now grown wherever wine is

                    Sauvignon Blanc is a green-skinned grape variety that originates from the Bordeaux region of France.
                    The grape most likely gets its name from the French words sauvage and blanc due to its early origins
                    as an indigenous grape in South West France.
